# MultiModel-Object-Detection
MultiModel-Object-Detection is a Python pipeline for annotating images, videos, and real-time webcam streams using TensorFlow object detection models (SSD, Faster R-CNN, RFCNN). It provides easy-to-use scripts for inference, visualization, and exporting annotated media, making it ideal for computer vision research and prototyping.
